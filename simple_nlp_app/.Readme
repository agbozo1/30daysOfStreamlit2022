Built with Streamlit, this simple app makes use of the following packages:
- [nltk](https://www.nltk.org/): For tokenization
- [spaCy](https://spacy.io/usage): For named-entity recognition
- [TextBlob](https://textblob.readthedocs.io/en/dev/#): For lemmatization, sentence correction and sentence subjectivity/polarity
